# Fake News Detector ðŸ“°ðŸ¤–

A Machine Learning project to detect fake vs real news articles using **TFâ€“IDF + Logistic Regression**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocesses and cleans news text (title + body)
- Extracts features with TFâ€“IDF (unigrams + bigrams)
- Trains Logistic Regression baseline model
- Evaluates with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC
- Saves trained model with `joblib`
- Predicts fake/real news from new input text
